		<p>I study the exchange of mathematics and metaphors between physics and social theory in the twentieth century. My dissertation constructs a history of entropy in American science, art, and economics. It examines how scientific debates over the definition of entropy in statistical mechanics, information theory, and complexity theory became coupled to moral claims about wealth and waste amid twentieth century environmental concerns.</p>

    <p>My research research has been supported by the American Institute of Physics, the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, and the Franke Program in Science and the Humanities at Yale. </p> Some of this work has been published in <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/hsns/article-abstract/54/4/461/203068/From-the-Model-to-the-GlanceHow-Astronomers?redirectedFrom=fulltext"><i>Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences</i></a> and <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/78/3/30/3337093/Learning-to-see-gravitational-lensesIn-the-1970s?"><i>Physics Today</i></a>.

		<p>Before arriving at Yale, I worked as a researcher in condensed matter physics.  Back then, I studied non-equilibrium electronic states, with the goal of understanding the interplay between magnetism and topology in candidate materials for high-efficiency electronics. </p>
